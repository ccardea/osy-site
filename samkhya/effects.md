title: The Theory of Existent Effects

In the Hindu theories of cause and effect, there are two kinds of causes:  
1. Material cause, and
2. Instrumental or efficient cause.  

The material cause is the substance out of which a thing is made. The instrumental causes are the people and the means that have a hand in the transformation of the material cause into the effect. The Theory of Existent Effects, which deals with the material causes of nature, is the theoretical foundation for the Tattvas. It is stated succinctly In these six sutras, which require little explanation.

### SPS 1.114.
- *Na asat-utpadah* = No production of the non-existent
- *Nri-sringa-vat* = like the horn of a man

There can be no production of the non-existent, like the horn of a man.

The horn of a man here is used as an example of something that is absolutely non-existent. It does not exist at any time past, present, or future, because there is nothing in existence that is capable of producing it. This is in contrast to things which are absolutely existent, like space and time, and things that exist at some times but not at others, such as the myriad objects produced in a particular form that exist for a time and eventually pass out of existence in that particular form.

### SPS 1.115
- *Upadana* = the material out of which anything is made, the material cause
- *Niyamat* = a rule, precept, or a law in general

Because there must be a material cause.

The author has stated a natural law, that everything in nature must have a material cause. He now gives the reasons why this is so.

### SPS 1.116 
- *Sarvatra* = in all places
- *Sarvada* = at all times
- *Sarva-asambhava* = on account of non-production of all things

Because all things are not produced in all places, at all times.

### SPS 1.117
- *Saktasya* = of the capable or competent
- *Sakya-karanat* = because of the execution or production of what is possible

Because the production of what is possible can be only from what is competent to produce it.

### SPS 1.118
- *Karana-bhavat* = from the effect having the nature of the cause
- *Cha* = also

And also from the effect having the nature of the cause.

A chair made out of wood isn't just a chair, it's a wooden chair.

### SPS 1.121
- *Nasah* = disappearance or destruction
- *Karana-layah* = dissolution into the cause

Destruction of a thing is dissolution into the cause.

### Perspective 

These six sutras are similar to the most basic laws of physics. This is remarkable considering the antiquity of the text. It is also remarkable that these sutras are based on observations of nature rather than scripture, and that these observations are confirmed by modern science. This further establishes the status of Samkhya as the beginning of science and the scientific way of thinking.
