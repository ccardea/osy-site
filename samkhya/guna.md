Unlike most of the Samkhya sutras encountered up to this point, which have been fairly self-explanatory, the sutras describing the gunas are more cryptic and require some explanation. The Samkhya Pravachana Sutram  and the Samkhya Karika emphasize different aspects but, even considering both sources, the picture is incomplete. Fortunately, more clarity will be found later in the study of the individual tattvas.

### SPS 1.127
- *Priti-apriti-visada-adiyaih* = by means of pleasantness, unpleasantness, dullness, etc.
- *Gunanam* = of the gunas
- *Anyonam* = from one another
- *Vaidharmyam* = difference in properties

The difference in properties of the gunas from one another arises by means of pleasantness, unpleasantness, and dullness, etc.

### SPS 1.128
- *Laghu-adi-dharmaih* = by the properties of lightness, etc.
- *Sadharmyam Vaidharmyam cha* = similarity and dissimilarity
- *Gunanam* = of the gunas

By means of the properties of lightness, etc. arise both the similarities and differences of the gunas.

### Karika 12
- *Priti-apriti-visada-atmakah* = having the nature of pleasure, pain, and dullness
- *Prakasa-pravritti-niyama-arthah* = for the purpose of illumination, activity, and restraint
- *Anya-anya-abhibhava* = mutual domination
- *Asraya* = That on which anything depends or rests or with which it is closely connected
- *Janana* = causing, production, creation
- *Mithuna* = union, junction; association
- *Vritttayah* = performing the functions of
- *Cha* = and
- *Gunah* = An ingredient or constituent of nature, any one of the three properties belonging to all created things

The gunas have the nature of pleasure, pain, and dullness, serve the purposes of illumination, activity, and restraint, and perform the functions of mutual domination, dependence, production, and association.

### Karika 13
- *Sattvam laghu prakasakam istam* = sattva is considered to be light and illuminating
- *Upastambhakam* = urgent, exciting (Sinha); supporting, aiding, encouraging (Apte)
- *Chalam* = versatile, restless (Sinha); Fraud, trick, deceit, deception (Apte)
- *Cha rajam* = and rajas
- *Guru* = heavy
- *Varanakam* = obstructing (Apte); enveloping, covering, obscuring (Sinha)
- *Eva* = to be sure
- *Tamah* = tamas
- *Pradipa-vat* = like a lamp
- *Cha* = and
- *Artha-tah* = for a purpose
- *Vrttih* = function, operation

Sattva is considered to be light and illuminating, and rajas to be exciting and deceptive, and tamas to be heavy and obscuring indeed. Like a lamp (consisting of oil, wick, and fire), they cooperate for a purpose.

### Perspective
Our explanation of the *gunas* begins with a quote from one of the very early Samkhya teachers, Acharya Panchasikha:
>What is called Sattva is of infinite variety under the forms of purity or clearness, lightness, love, agreeableness, renunciation, contentment, etc., which are summed up by the word Pleasant. Similarly, Rajas also possesses many varieties, such as grief, etc., which are summed up by the word Painful. So also does Tamas possess many varieties, such as sleep,, etc. which are summed up by the word Bewildering.

The theory of three *guna* is derived from properties observed in nature. All of the myriad manifestations of nature were believed to have some combination of these three properties inherent in them. For instance, there are some products or manifestations of *Buddhi* that are *sattvic* in nature, and some manifestations of *Ahamkara* that also are *sattvic* in nature. Since this quality of *sattva* is observed in different types of manifestations, it implies that *sattva* exists independent of any particular manifestation. 

In contrast it is observed that not all manifestations of *Buddhi* or *Ahamkara* are *sattvic* in nature. Some have the nature of *rajas* or *tamas*. This implies that all three *guna* are present in all manifestations of Prakriti, but different *guna* are dominant depending on the particular instance. 

In some other philosophical systems, *gunas* were thought of as properties or qualities of substances. In the Samkhya system, because they are the constituent parts of Prakriti, the gunas are considered to be substances themselves and their characteristics are inherent in the manifestations of nature.
