Samkhya philosophy is perhaps best known for its enumeration of twenty-five tattvas, that is, truths or principles. The sutras that follow briefly describe them. These sutras are fairly self-explanatory, but the reader should not overlook the translations of the Sanskrit words and phrases, since a lot of information is provided there. Following the sutras is a brief explanation of a few things that are not explicitly spelled out in the sutras themselves.

### SPS 1.61
- *Sattva-rajas-tamasam* =  of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas, the three gunas, or constituents of nature
- *Samya-avastha* = the state of being neither less nor more; state of equilibrium
- *Prakriti* = one that multiplies, modifies, procreates; that which brings forth, a mother
- *Prakriteh mahan* = from Prakriti, Mahat - the Great One; also called Buddhi
- *Mahatah Ahamkara* = from Mahat, Ahamkara - the I-maker; principle of individuality
- *Ahamkarat pancha tan-matrani* = from Ahamkara, five tan-matras - subtle elements
- *Ubhayam* = both
- *Indriyam* = Instruments 
- *Tan-matrebyam sthula-bhutani* = from the tan-matras, the coarse elements
- *Purusa* = self, spirit
- *Iti panca-vimsatih ganah* = such are the group of twenty-five 

Prakriti is sattva, rajas, and tamas in the state of equilibrium. From Prakriti evolves Mahat, from Mahat evolves Ahamkara, from Ahamkara evolve both the five tan-matras and the Indriyas. From the tan-matras, the coarse elements.  (These twenty-four)  and Purusa, constitute the group of twenty-five tattvas or principles.

### SPS 1.67
- *Mula* = The root
- *Mula-abhavat* = absence of root
- *Amulam mulam* = the root is rootless

Since the root (Prakriti) has no root, the root is rootless.

### SPS 1.68
- *Paramparye api* = even in the case of a succession
- *Ekatra* = at some one point
- *Parinistha* = rest, halt
- *Iti samjna-matram* = so it is merely a name

Even in the case of a succession, at some point there must be a stop, so it (prakriti) is just a name (given to such a point).

### SPS 1.126
- *Triguna-achetanatva-adi* = being composed of three gunas, being unconscious, etc
- *Dvayoh* = of both 

Both (Prakriti and her products) are composed of three gunas, are unconscious, etc.

### Tattva-Samasa 2
- *Kathayami* = describe, declare
- *Astau prakritayah* = eight prakritis

There are eight prakritis.

2 types of prakriti:
1. The root prakriti
2. Prakriti-vikriti = both mother principle and product: Mahat, Ahamkara, and five Tan-matras

### Tattva-Samasa 3
- *Sodasakah* = sixteenfold
- *Tu* = only
- *Vikarah* = transformation, modification, product

Transformations only are sixteen. (Eleven Indriyas, five Tan-matras)

### Karika 3
- *Mula prakritih a-vikritih* = the root prakriti is not a product (of any other cause)
- *Mahat-adyah prakriti-vikritayah sapta* = Mahat, etc are the seven prakriti-vikriti
- *Sodasakah tu vikarah* = transformations only are sixteen
- *Na prakritih na vikritih purusah* = Purusa is neither mother principle nor transformation

The root prakriti is not a product of any other cause. Seven, which are Mahat, Ahamkara, and five Tan-matras, are both mother principle and transformation. Transformations only are sixteen. Purusa is neither mother principle nor transformation.

### Perspective
The author has enumerated the twenty-five tattvas or principles that make up both the entire natural world and the self, along with their order of evolution. The enumeration is as follows
- The root Prakriti
- Mahat
- Ahamkara
	- 11 Indriyas:
		- Five indriyas of cognition: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin
		- Five indriyas of action: arms, legs, speech, sex, excretion
		- Manas, having characteristics of both cognition and action
	- 5 Tan-matras: sound, color, mass (touch), odor, and flavor
- 5 Coarse or gross elements: earth, air, fire, water, akasa consisting of space and time
- Purusa

In the state of equilibrium of the gunas, the root Prakriti is unmanifest. When the equilibrium is disturbed, then Prakriti begins to manifest as her products. Properties common to both Prakriti and her products are:
- being composed of the gunas,
- being unintelligent, and
- undergoing transformation, among others.  

Purusa is the opposite of the Manifest and Unmanifest in that it is not composed of the gunas. It does not participate in the transformations of Prakriti, but is merely the Witness, and it is the intelligent principle, that is, the Knower. 

The author has described a system of two ultimates, Prakriti and Purusa. This is the primary difference between Samkhya and Advaita Vedanta, which postulates a single ultimate called Brahman, which is both self and the source of the world. In the Samkhya system, Prakriti is the ultimate material cause of the world and Purusa is the self.

The Samkhya description of the natural world as composed of five gross elements and five subtle elements represents the beginnings of scientific inquiry, an early attempt to explain the world without reference to any deity or supernatural influence. The problems addressed by the Samkhya tattvas are notable for their similarity to what is now known as theoretical physics. Perhaps of greatest significance to the yoga practitioner is the distinction between coarse and subtle elements. The coarse or gross elements are perceivable by the senses, while the subtle elements are known by reasoning or by revelation. This distinction between perceivable and subtle objects is prominent in the Yoga Sutras. The reader should keep in mind that the gross and subtle elements of Samkhya are the elements of experience and, while not particularly useful from a scientific point of view, they are still useful for the purposes of yoga. Of greatest interest to the yoga practitioner or meditator will be the tattvas that make up the Internal Instrument, which will be a subject of further discussion.
