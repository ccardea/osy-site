### Sutra 2
*Kathyami austau Prakritayah*
- *Kathyami* = declare, describe 
- *austau* = eight
- *Prakritayah* = untranslated

Describe eight Prakritis.

A *prakriti* is a tattva that multiplies, changes and evolves, procreates and brings forth another. There are two types of *prakritis*. The first is the pure or root *prakriti*, the primordial soup from which everything else evolves, but which has not itself evolved from anything else. It is a singular entity, eternal, pervasive throughout material nature, and unintelligent. It is composed of the three *gunas* (*sattva, rajas, and tamas*) in a state of equilibrium, that is equal measures of each, with none being dominant. In this state, *prakriti* is unmanifest and exists only as pure potential.

When the equilibrium of the root *prakriti* is disturbed, then the other, mixed *prakritis* begin to evolve from it. Unlike the root *prakriti*, they are many and not pervasive. They are the manifest forms of material nature. Like the root *prakriti*, they are unintelligent, yet they evolve further into other tattvas. The pure *prakriti* is their root cause, but they evolve in a particular order. Mahat, the great, is the first transformation of the root *prakriti*. From Mahat evolves Ahamkara, and from Ahamkara evolves the five *tan-matras*. Thus there is one root *prakriti* and seven that are both transformations and *prakritis*, for a total of eight *prakritis*. Mahat, in its individual form, is called Buddhi. Its function is ascertainment or understanding. Ahamkara is the principle of individuality, the doer or agent. The five tan-matras are the subtle forms of the objective world of experience, i.e., light or color, sound, touch, taste, and smell.
        
Although unintelligent, the *prakritis* are understood to evolve from their own power as the forces of nature. There is no sentient being directing their evolution by the force of his will.
