The Samkhya philosophy has its roots in the problem of suffering. All sentient creatures experience pleasure and pain. All desire to experience pleasure and to remove or avoid pain. The two normally can't co-exist for very long, pain has to be removed in order to experience pleasure. The highest good, therefore, is believed to be the permanent removal of pain. 

Samkhya describes three categories of suffering:
- Physical and mental pain originating from oneself;
- Pain caused by others, including animals, insects, and other humans;
- Pain caused by natural forces beyond our control.



Some kinds of pain are avoidable, most notably, pain that one causes oneself. The sutras seek to illuminate those things that are the causes of avoidable pain and the means of avoidance. Other types of pain are unavoidable and will continue to be experienced as long as one exists as a material being. The only way to permanently remove such pain is to become free from material nature itself. Therefore, in the Samkhya system, which was adopted by virtually all Hindus, the highest good is release from samsara, the cycle of birth, life, suffering, death, and rebirth.

Through much deliberation, the ancient Samkhya seers concluded that individual beings exist in material nature because of the mistaken identification of the self with material nature, that is our bodies and minds. The means of freeing oneself from material nature is the ability to correctly distinguish or discriminate between the true self and the not-self, and this requires perfect, scientific knowledge of what constitutes material nature and firsthand experience of the true self.

The Tattva Samasa was the first attempt to systematically impart the knowledge that leads to discrimination of self from not-self.

### Sutra 1
*Atha atah tattva samasah*
- *Atha* = now, the beginning of an undertaking 
- *atah* = therefore, as a result
- *tattva* = principles, truths
- *samasah* = a collection, compilation

Now, therefore a compilation of principles (is desired).
