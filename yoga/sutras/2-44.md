### *Svadhyayad* - Self-Study
*Svadhyayad* is commonly translated as "self-study" or study which leads to the knowledge of the self. However, Sutra 2-44 reveals a meaning that goes far beyond this translation of the word. It says that through *svadhyayad*, the yogi attains contact with the *ista-devata*, or chosen deity. This refers to Hindu and Buddhist practices that consist of many repetitions of mantras associated with particular deities. 

As modern practitioners, most of whom do not engage in Hindu or Buddhist deity practices, what are we to make of this? Is it just something that was practiced by the ancient yogis that we can safely ignore? Most people are familiar with the concept of prayer. *Svadhyayad* can be thought of simply as prayer, with no prescribed deity.

The first use of the word *svadhyayad* is earlier in Sutra 2-1, where it is mentioned as being a component of Kriya Yoga, which is practiced for the purpose of attenuating *klesas* (causes of affliction) and for cultivating *samadhi*. The sutra encourages deity practices, but does not provide instruction on how to practice. If desired, that knowledge must be obtained from other sources.
