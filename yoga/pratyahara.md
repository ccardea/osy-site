title: Pratyahara - Control of the Senses
---
### Sutra 2.54
*Sva-viṣaya-asamprayoge cittasya sva-rūpa-anukāra iva-indriyāṇāṁ pratyāhāraḥ*
- *Sva-viṣaya-asamprayoge* = not connected with their objects
- *cittasya* = of the mind, of citta
- *sva-rūpa-anukāra* = resembling the essential form
- *iva* = as if 
- *indriyāṇāṁ* = instruments or organs of sense
- *pratyāhāraḥ* is being defined here

Resembling the nature of the mind, as if the senses are not connected with their objects, is *pratyahara*.

### Sutra 2.55
*Tataḥ paramā vaśyata-indriyāṇām*
- *Tataḥ* = from that
- *paramā* = supreme
- *vaśyata* = control or subjugation
- *indriyāṇām* = of the senses

From that, [the yogi gains] supreme control of the senses.

This is the traditional translation of these two sutras. It is explained with the analogy of a queen bee and the worker bees. When the queen bee leaves the hive, the worker bees follow, and where she rests, the worker bees also rest. Here, the queen bee is a metaphor for *citta*, and the worker bees are the senses.

Most people have experienced the phenomenon of being so absorbed in something that they fail to notice what is happening around them. The senses are always functioning, but it is the contact of the mind or awareness that actually causes us to perceive the sensations that they receive. *Pratyahara* is taken to mean turning the mind inward, as if it has been detached from the senses and their objects.

There is not necessarily a sequential progression from *pranayama* to *pratyahara* to *dharana*, the next limb. *Dharana* can be and often is performed on perceivable objects. In that case, *pratyahara* obviously could not precede it. But at some point in the process of yoga, the yogi must turn away from the senses and their objects and focus on the inner layers of consciousness. *Pratyahara* is the transition from the external practice of yoga to the internal practice.
