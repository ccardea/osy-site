title: Elimination of Impurity
---
In Asta-Anga Yoga, elimination of impurity is accomplished through the yamas and niyamas. Following their definitions, Patanjali explains the philosophy behind them. Following that, the yamas and niyamas are discussed individually.

### Sutra 2.30
The *yamas* are:  
- *Ahiṁsā* = not-harming,
- *satya* = truthfulness,
- *asteya* = not-stealing,
- *brahmacarya* = continence,
- *aparigrahā* = *apari* the opposite of + *graha* grasping, greed, avarice

### Sutra 2.32 
The *niyamas* are:
- *Śauca* = Cleansing, purifying
- *santoṣa* = contentment
- *tapaḥ* = austerity
- *svādhyāya* = study of scriptures, chanting of mantras
- *iśvara-praṇidhāna* = devotion to isvara, the supreme being or god

### Sutra 2.33
*Vitarka bādhane pratipakṣa-bhāvanam*  
- *Vitarka* = thinking, reasoning, reflecting
- *bādhane* = oppressing, disturbing
- *pratipakṣa* = contrary, adverse
- *bhāvanam* = creating, manifesting; contemplation

Disturbing thoughts [should be countered by] cultivating the opposites

### Sutra 2.34
*Vitarkā hiṁsa-adayaḥ kṛta-kārita-anumoditā lobha-krodha-moha-pūrvakā mṛdu-madhya-adhimātrā duḥkha-ajñāna-ananta-phalā iti pratipakṣa-bhāvanam*  
- *Vitarkā* = thoughts, thinking
- *hiṁsa-adayaḥ* = harmful
- *kṛta* = done, performed
- *kārita* = caused to be done or effected
- *anumoditā* = approval, assent
- *lobha* = greed, avarice
- *krodha* = anger
- *moha* = delusion, infatuation; lust
- *pūrvakā* = preceded by, preceding; arising from
- *mṛdu* = mild
- *madhya* = middle, central
- *adhimātrā* = excessive, inordinate
- *duḥkha* = sorrow, grief, unhappiness
- *ajñāna* = ignorance
- *ananta* = endless, infinite, eternal
- *phalā* = result, fruit, consequence, effect
- *iti* = so, thus, in this manner
- *pratipakṣa-bhāvanam* = cultivating the opposites

Harmful thinking arising from lust, anger, and greed; whether done, caused to be done, or approved; whether mild, medium, or excessive; results in unending ignorance and sorrow, therefore the yogi should cultivate the opposites.

#### Discussion
Here, Patanjali is explaining why the yogi must practice the *yamas* and *niyamas*. The impurities that the yogi seeks to eliminate are those harmful thoughts and actions arising from delusion, anger, and greed. Elimination is desired because they result in unending ignorance and sorrow. The means of elimination is manifesting or bringing into being their opposites. The opposites are *yama* and *niyama*.

Patanjali brings out the subtle point that the yogi cannot avoid the unwanted results by simply not getting his own hands dirty. The results are the same whether he is the actual perpetrator, the mastermind, or simply approves. Similarly, reducing his level of participation to just a little bit will not get the desired result. The goal is elimination.
