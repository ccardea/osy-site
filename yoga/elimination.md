title: Elimination of Impurities
---
In the original text of the Yoga Sutras, the two sutras presented here come after *yama* and *niyama* have been defined. Old School Yoga presents them first in order to emphasize the purpose of *yama* and *niyama*, which is elimination of impurities. Also, in these sutras, we learn what is meant by impurity.

### Sutra 2.33
*Vitarka bādhane pratipakṣa-bhāvanam*  
- *Vitarka* = thinking, reasoning, reflecting
- *bādhane* = oppressing, disturbing
- *pratipakṣa* = contrary, adverse
- *bhāvanam* = creating, manifesting; contemplation

Disturbing thoughts [should be countered by] cultivating the opposites.

### Sutra 2.34
*Vitarkā hiṁsa-adayaḥ kṛta-kārita-anumoditā lobha-krodha-moha-pūrvakā mṛdu-madhya-adhimātrā duḥkha-ajñāna-ananta-phalā iti pratipakṣa-bhāvanam*  
- *Vitarkā* = thoughts, thinking
- *hiṁsa-adayaḥ* = harmful
- *kṛta* = done, performed
- *kārita* = caused to be done or effected
- *anumoditā* = approval, assent
- *lobha* = greed, avarice
- *krodha* = anger
- *moha* = delusion, infatuation; lust
- *pūrvakā* = preceded by, preceding; arising from
- *mṛdu* = mild
- *madhya* = middle, central
- *adhimātrā* = excessive, inordinate
- *duḥkha* = sorrow, grief, unhappiness
- *ajñāna* = ignorance
- *ananta* = endless, infinite, eternal
- *phalā* = result, fruit, consequence, effect
- *iti* = so, thus, in this manner
- *pratipakṣa-bhāvanam* = cultivating the opposites

Harmful thinking arising from delusion, anger, and greed; whether done, caused to be done, or approved; whether mild, medium, or excessive; results in unending ignorance and sorrow, therefore, the yogi should cultivate the opposites.

#### Discussion
Here, Patanjali is explaining why the yogi practices *yama* and *niyama*. The impurities that the yogi seeks to eliminate are those harmful thoughts and actions arising from delusion, anger, and greed. Elimination is desired because the harmful activities inevitably come to fruition as unending ignorance and sorrow. If the yogi engages in things such as violence, lying, stealing, etc., his life is bound to be beset by trouble and sorrow. In these conditions, calming of the *citta-vrrti* is impossible. 

It must be understood that the undesireable conditions resulting from harmful activities are due to the natural forces of karma. They are not thought of as punishments meted out by an offended god. Karma is thought of as operating like the laws of physics, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. 

Patanjali brings out the point that the yogi cannot avoid the unwanted results by simply not getting his own hands dirty. The results are the same whether he is the actual perpetrator, the mastermind, or simply approves. Similarly, reducing his level of participation to just a little bit will not get the desired result. The goal is elimination. 

The means of elimination is manifesting or bringing into being their opposites. The opposites are *yama* and *niyama*.
