title: What Is Yoga?
---
The philosophy of yoga is explained in a nutshell by these three sutras:

> 1.2 - Yoga is the restraint of the fluctuations of consciousness.  
1.3 - Then the seer [i.e. the Self] abides in its own form.  
1.4 - At other times there is conformity [of the self] with the fluctuations. 
> 
>> *- adapted from the translation by Georg Feuerstein*

This gives us the big picture. Let's examine these one by one, in reverse order.

### Sutra 1.4
*Vṛtti-sārūpyam-itaratra*  
At other times (*itaratra*) there is conformity (*sārūpyam*) [of the self with] the fluctuations (*Vṛtti*).

This is where we are now, the normal condition of human consciousness. As we go about our daily lives, we *identify* with the activity of our minds.

### Sutra 1.3
*Tadā draṣṭuḥ svarūpe'vasthānam*  
Then (*tadā*), the Seer (*draṣṭuḥ*) abides in (*avasthānam*) its own-form (*sva-rūpa*).

This is where we want to go. The self no longer falsely identifies with the fluctuations of the mind. It now correctly understands its real nature.

### Sutra 1.2 
*Yogaś-citta-vṛtti-nirodhaḥ*  
Yoga is the restraint (*nirodhaḥ*) of the fluctuations (*vṛtti*) of consciousness (*citta*).

This is how we get there. Let's look at each word individually.

#### *yoga*
Yoga is the subject of the definition. It is one of many words that Patanjali defines for us.

#### *citta*
Usually translated as "the mind" or "consciousness", neither is exact. *Citta* is defined precisely by its *vrtti*.

#### *vrtti*
*Vrtti* is variously translated as fluctuations, modifications, or functions, among other things. Patanjali enumerates five *citta-vrtti*: 
- *Pramāṇa* = the means of right knowledge, which are: 
    - perception = the operation of the senses,
    - inference = all forms of reasoning and logic, and
    - word = learning from trusted sources like books and teachers
- *viparyaya* = mis-perception resulting in false or mistaken knowledge;
- *vikalpa* = knowledge that is verbal only, without any underlying object;
- *nidrā* = sleep;
- *smṛti* = memory.

*Citta* is that which is known by these five *vrtti*, which really are not so much fluctuations but are functions of *citta*. 

#### *nirodha*
*Nirodha* is variously translated as restraint, restriction, focusing, or stopping. There seems to be a bit of conflict there, since stopping is a lot different from restraining or focusing. In reality, *nirodha* is both the act of focusing or restraining and the state of complete cessation of *citta-vrtti*. Only by the most advanced yogis get complete cessation. Students should not attempt to sit in meditation and stop their mind. All of the Eight Limbs are efforts directed toward calming and focusing the *citta-vrtti*. 

### Sutra 1.5
*Vṛttayaḥ pañcatayyaḥ kliṣṭā akliṣṭāḥ* 
- *Vṛttayaḥ pañcatayyaḥ* = fivefold *vrtti*
- *kliṣṭā* = affliction, anguish, distress, pain 
- *akliṣṭāḥ* = the opposite of kliṣṭā; untroubled, undisturbed

The five *citta-vrtti* may be painful or undisturbed.

This is a very important point. Those who minds are disturbed by delusion, anger, greed, or passions in general need to correct those things before higher yoga is possible. A large part of the Yoga Sutras is concerned with overcoming those sorts of things.
