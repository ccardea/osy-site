title: What Is Yoga?
---
The philosophy of yoga is explained in a nutshell by these three sutras:

> 1.2 - Yoga is the restraint of the fluctuations of consciousness.  
1.3 - Then the seer [i.e. the Self] abides in its essence.  
1.4 - At other times there is identity [of the self] and the fluctuations.

>> *- adapted from the translation by Georg Feuerstein*

This gives us the big picture. Let's examine these one by one, in reverse order.

### Sutra 1.4
*Vṛtti-sārūpyam-itaratra*  
At other times (*itaratra*) there is conformance (*sārūpyam*) [of the self and] the fluctuations (*Vṛtti*).

This is where we are now, the normal condition of human consciousness as we go about our daily lives. We *identify* with the activity of our minds.

### Sutra 1.3
*Tadā draṣṭuḥ svarūpe'vasthānam*  
Then (*tadā*), the Seer (*draṣṭuḥ*) abides in (*avasthānam*) its essence (*sva-rūpa*).

This is where we want to go. The self no longer falsely identifies with the fluctuations of the mind, it now correctly understands its real nature.

### Sutra 1.2 
*Yogaś-citta-vṛtti-nirodhaḥ*  
Yoga is the restraint (*nirodhaḥ*) of the fluctuations (*vṛtti*) of consciousness (*citta*).

This is how we get there. Let's look at each word individually.

#### *yoga*
Yoga is the subject of the definition. It is one of many words that Patanjali defines for us.

#### *citta*
Usually translated as "the mind" or "consciousness", neither is exact. *Citta* is actually defined precisely by its *vrtti*.

#### *vrtti*
*Vrtti* is variously translated as fluctuations, modifications, or functions, among other things. Patanjali enumerates  5 *citta-vrtti*: 
- *Pramāṇa* = the means of right knowledge, which are perception, inference, and word;
- *viparyaya* = false, erroneous, or mistaken knowledge;
- *vikalpa* = knowledge that is verbal only, without any underlying object;
- *nidrā* = sleep;
- *smṛti* = memory.

*Citta* is that which is known by these five *vrtti*, which really are not so much fluctuations but are functions of *citta*. At this point, we are not too concerned with what are the five *citta-vrtti*. Sutra 1.5 tells us that they can be either *klista* or *a-klista*, that is, causing affliction or not causing affliction. That will have more relevance for us as we begin to study the 8 Limbs.
