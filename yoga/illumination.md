title: Illumination of Understanding
---
This article discusses the final three limbs of yoga, which were classified earlier as illumination of understanding. The sutras touch on *dharana*, *dhyana*, and *samadhi* lightly here, with just enough information for the yogi to begin the practice. More thorough explanations can be found in elsewhere in the Yoga Sutras and in other texts.

### Sutra 3.1
*Deśa-bandhaś-cittasya dhāraṇā*
- *Deśa* = a place, spot
- *bandhaś* = tie, bond, confining
- *cittasya* = the mind, consciousness
- *dhāraṇā* = concentration

*Dharana* is binding the mind to [one] place.

In modern language, *dharana* is concentration, focusing the mind on one thing. It is the first step in the process of meditation, in which we strive to keep the mind focused, being mindful of when it strays, and bringing it back to the object of concentration. In modern times, this is a common skill that's necessary in all types of work and play. It may not have been as common in Patanjali's time. 

For the purposes of yoga, the real question is, what place? What should we focus on and for what purpose? What are the objects of meditation? There is a lot of discussion of this both in the Yoga Sutras and in related texts. This will be covered in detail elsewhere.

### Sutra 3.2
*Tatra pratyaya-ekatānatā dhyānam*
- *Tatra* = in that
- *pratyaya* = a thought, idea; mental process
- *eka-tān-atā* = to continue as one
- *dhyānam* = meditation

In that (concentration), *dhyana* [is when] the thoughts continue as one.

Here, Patanjali defines *dhyana* as a continuation of *dharana*, when the mind is concentrated and the thoughts that arise are related to the object of focus, without straying from it. This definition is unique to the 8 limbs. The term *dhyana* is used in at least three more ways, both in the Yoga Sutras and in related texts. This will be discussed in more detail elsewhere.

### Sutra 3.3
*Tad-eva-artha-mātra-nirbhāsaṁ sva-rūpa-śūnyam-iva samādhiḥ*
- *Tad-eva* = so also
- *artha-mātra-nirbhāsaṁ* = the object only shining forth
- *sva-rūpa-śūnyam-iva* = as if empty of its essence
- *samādhiḥ* = untranslated

So also, [with] the object only shining forth, as if [the mind is] empty of its essence, is *samadhi*.

*Samadhi* is the highest form of object-focused meditation, in which the yogi has gone beyond words and the thinking mind, as if he is not even aware of himself, and is able to directly comprehend the true nature of the object of concentration. This again is discussed in more detail elsewhere in the Yoga Sutras.

### Sutra 3.4
*Trayam-ekatra saṁyamaḥ*
- *Trayam* = the three
- *ekatra* = together
- *saṁyamaḥ* = untranslated

The three together [on one object] is *samyama*.

*Samyama* is a technical term used to describe meditation on a single object that progresses from *dharana* to *samadhi*.

### Sutra 3.5
*Taj-jayāt-prajña-alokaḥ*
- *Taj-jayāt* = Success in that
- *prajña* = knowledge, transcendental insight
- *alokaḥ* = seeing, beholding; light, lustre

Succeeding in that, the light of transcendental insight [is revealed].

This is a succinct statement of what is meant by illumination of understanding. In the processes of meditation described here, the yogi is seeking a type of insight that goes beyond what can be achieved through the thinking mind alone. His understanding becomes like a transparent crystal that has been refined to the point where it perfectly reflects the light "shining forth" from the object of concentration.

### Sutra 3.6
*Tasya bhūmiṣu viniyogaḥ*
- *Tasya* = of that
- *bhūmiṣu* = stages
- *viniyogaḥ* = application

The application of that (concentration), [proceeds in] stages.

And the stages are *dharana, dhyana*, and *samadhi*.

### Sutra 3.7
*Trayam-antar-aṅgaṁ pūrvebhyaḥ*
- *Trayam* = the three 
- *antar-aṅgaṁ* = inner members
- *pūrvebhyaḥ* = previous to, earlier than

The previous three (*dharana, dhyana, and samadhi*) are the inner members.

Of the eight limbs, the five discussed earlier are the outer limbs. *Dharana, dhyana, and samadhi* are the inner limbs.

### Sutra 3.8
*Tad-api vahir-aṅgaṁ nirbījasya*
- *Tad-api* = these also
- *vahir-aṅgaṁ* = outer members
- *nirbījasya* = with respect to the seedless

These also are the outer members with respect to the seedless.

Just when we thought we were finished, Patanjali has said, not so fast. There's more to it. The stages of meditation that have been described here are classified as *sa-bija*, that is, with seed. The Sutras are telling us that there is another class of practice that is *nir-bija*, without seed. The concepts of *sabija* and *nirbija* can be somewhat controversial. The practices described here must be mastered before the *nirbija* practice can begin, so it is of little use to discuss it further at this point.

Sutra 3.8 concludes the 8 Limbs portion of the Yoga Sutras.
