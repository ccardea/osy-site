### Sutra 2.46
*Sthira-sukham-āsanam*
- *Sthira* = Firm, steady, fixed
- *sukham* = Agreeable, pleasant; Easy, practicable; Fit, suitable
- *āsanam* = Sitting down; A seat, place, stool; A particular posture or mode of sitting

*Asana* [should be] steady and comfortable.

### Sutra 2.47
*Prayatna-śaithilya-ananta-samāpattibhyām*
- *Prayatna* = Effort, exertion, endeavour
- *śaithilya* = Looseness, laxity, relaxation of rule
- *ananta* = Endless, infinite, eternal, boundless, inexhaustible
- *samāpatti* = Meeting, encountering; assuming an original form

[Accompanied by] relaxation of effort [and] assuming the form of the infinite.

The definition of *samapatti* that is used here is taken from Sutra 1.41. Patanjali himself defines *samapatti* as an advanced form of object-focused meditation.  Notice, however, that the yogi is not instructed to focus on an object, rather, he/she is instructed to become one with it, to assume its form and identity. 

### Sutra 2.48
*Tato dvandva-anabhighātaḥ*
- *Tato* = From that (person or place &c.), thence
- *dvandva* = pair, couple; pairs of opposites
- *anabhighātaḥ* = immunity, unassailability

From that, [the yogi remains] undisturbed by the pairs of opposites.

### Perspective
In these three sutras, Patanjali is talking about seated asana practice. He describes a simple practice that requires nothing more than becoming still and relaxing all effort to the point where the yogi becomes at one with the infinite, like a drop of water in the ocean or a grain of sand on a beach. Doing only that, the yogi attains a deep state of meditation. 

Following that is the startling claim that, through this meditation, the yogi can remain undisturbed by the pairs of opposites, such as hot and cold, joy and sorrow. Some yogis have been known to meditate in extremes of heat and cold in order to prove this point. It can be thought of as entering a trance-like state, but the practice is probably more commonly used simply to develop and maintain equanimity or to get a brief respite from everyday life. 

These sutras are difficult to reconcile with modern yoga practices that are more movement oriented and often involve a great deal of effort. The yogi must first understand that reaching the state of deep relaxation does not happen instantaneously. Various postures and other techniques aid the yogi in relaxing tension. The yogi can sometimes get deeper into an asana by relaxing into it. He/she can learn to relax even in difficult or uncomfortable postures. Ultimately, finding and releasing tension in the body is also an effort that must be relaxed.

The yogi must question what exactly is meant by the term *ananta*, the infinite. Is it merely a mathematical concept or is it ultimately real? If it is ultimately real, what is its nature and how can it be observed? If the infinite is not an object that can be observed, what else could it be? By definition, *samapatti* requires an object.

What does it mean to become one with an object (infinity)? This is often understood as merely a figure of speech, but according to Sutra 1.41, it is a highly technical and advanced form of yoga, which requires knowledge and expertise that is beyond the scope of this discussion. In a nutshell, to be one with an object is to perceive it correctly and to understand it perfectly. For now, it may be helpful to picture oneself as a drop of water in the ocean or a grain of sand on a beach.
