### Sutra 2.49
*Tasmin-sati śvāsa-praśvāsayor-gati-vicchedaḥ prāṇāyāmaḥ*
- *Tasmin-sati* = when this is achieved
- *śvā-sa* = Breathing, breath, respiration: breath moving in
- *pra-śvā-sayor* = breath, respiration: breath moving out
- *gati* = motion, going, moving
- *vicchedaḥ* = cutting, breaking, interrupting
- *prāṇāyāma* is being defined here

When this is achieved [the yogi should practice] *prāṇāyāma*, [which is] interrupting the motion of the breath coming in and going out.

When this has been achieved refers to becoming steady and relaxed in asana. Interrupting the motion of the breath seems to refer to the practice known as *kumbhaka*, or stopping the movement of breath either at the end of inhalation or the end of exhalation. Patanjali defines *pranayama* in terms of *kumbhaka*, which gives the sense that he regarded *kumbhaka* as important. However, well respected teachers have said that this should not be attempted until basic inhalation and exhalation practices have been mastered.  

An alternative explanation is that Patanjali is not referring to *kumbhaka*, but simply to interrupting the natural, automatic flow of the breath and taking conscious control.

### Sutra 2.50
*bāhya-abhyantara-stambha-vṛttir-deśa-kāla-saṅkhyābhiḥ paridṛṣṭo dīrgha-sūkṣmaḥ*
- *bāhya-abhyantara-stambha-vṛttir* = it's modes of operation are outward, inward, and fixed
- *deśa-kāla-saṅkhyābhiḥ* = place, time, and number
- *paridṛṣṭo* = to appear or become visible: observed
- *dīrgha* = of long duration
- *sūkṣmaḥ* = subtle; small

Its [the breath] modes of operation are outward, inward, and fixed, it can be observed by place, time, and number, which can be long or short, greater or less. 

We are all familiar with inhalation and exhalation. Patanjali adds a third mode of breathing which is fixed, again referring to stopping the motion of the breath. To be observed refers to the ways in which breath can be regulated. Some Hindu literature refers to stopping the breath in different places. Since we cannot direct our breath anywhere but into our lungs, it is obvious that Patanjali is using *pranayama* here in the sense of energy that we can consciously direct to different parts of our bodies. Time refers to lengthening or shortening the breath, number refers to the number of repetitions of any particular exercise.

### Sutra 2.51
*bāhya-abhyantara-viṣaya-akṣepī caturthaḥ*
- *bāhya-abhyantara* = inward and outward
- *viṣaya* = an object or thing
- *akṣepī* = transcending or excelling
- *caturthaḥ* = the fourth

The object transcending the inward and outward [movement of the breath] is the fourth.



### Sutra 2.52
*Tataḥ kṣīyate prakāśa-avaraṇam*
- *Tataḥ* = thence, from that
- *kṣīyate* = to diminish, cause to waste away
- *prakāśa* = bright, shining; light
- *avaraṇam* = covering, concealing

From that, the covering of [the inner] light is diminished.

### Sutra 2.53
*Dhāraṇāsu ca yogyatā manasaḥ*
- *Dhāraṇāsu* = for dharana
- *ca yogyatā manasaḥ* = and fitness of the mind

And [the yogi acquires] fitness of the mind for dharana
