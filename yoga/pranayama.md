### Sutra 2.49
*Tasmin-sati śvāsa-praśvāsayor-gati-vicchedaḥ prāṇāyāmaḥ*
- *Tasmin-sati* = when this is achieved
- *śvā-sa* = Breathing, breath, respiration: breath moving in
- *pra-śvā-sayor* = breath, respiration: breath moving out
- *gati* = motion, going, moving
- *vicchedaḥ* = cutting, breaking, interrupting
- *prāṇāyāma* is being defined here

When this is achieved [the yogi should practice] *prāṇāyāma*, [which is] interrupting the motion of the breath coming in and going out.

When this has been achieved refers to becoming steady and relaxed in asana. Interrupting the motion of the breath refers to the practice known as *kumbhaka*, or stopping the movement of breath, either at the end of inhalation or the end of exhalation. Patanjali defines *pranayama* in terms of *kumbhaka*, which gives the sense that he regarded *kumbhaka* as important. 

Caution! Well respected teachers have said that this should not be attempted until basic inhalation and exhalation practices have been mastered.  

### Sutra 2.50
*bāhya-abhyantara-stambha-vṛttir-deśa-kāla-saṅkhyābhiḥ paridṛṣṭo dīrgha-sūkṣmaḥ*
- *bāhya-abhyantara-stambha-vṛttir* = it's modes of operation are outward, inward, and fixed
- *deśa-kāla-saṅkhyābhiḥ* = place, time, and number
- *paridṛṣṭo* = to appear or become visible: observed
- *dīrgha* = of long duration
- *sūkṣmaḥ* = subtle; small

Its [the breath's] modes of operation are outward, inward, and fixed, when observed by place, time, and number, [it becomes] long and subtle. 

There are differing explanations of this sutra. The simple and seemingly obvious one is that the three modes of operation refer to inhalation, exhalation, and *kumbhaka*. The older, more traditional translators are adamant that this is not the case, that inward and outward refers to the places where *kumbhaka* is performed, and that *stambha* is not *kumbhaka* but a practice of suppressing the breath in which breathing is sometimes suspended for long periods of time.

Likewise, there are differing explanations as to the meaning of place. There are other Hindu texts that refer to stopping the breath in different places. Based on that, breath can be understood as a metaphor for *prana* or energy, which can be consciously directed to various parts of the body. Breath can also be stopped physically in different places, such as chest, ribs, and diaphragm. 

Time is generally understood to mean the relative amount of time spent in inhalation and exhalation, and is usually thought of as lengthening or shortening the breath. Number is understood to be the number of repetitions of a particular exercise. To be observed refers to the ways in which breath can be regulated. The traditional translators take "long and subtle" to be the desired results when breath is regulated as prescribed. Others see it as referring to time and number, in a relation of more or less.

### Sutra 2.51
*bāhya-abhyantara-viṣaya-akṣepī caturthaḥ*
- *bāhya-abhyantara* = inward and outward
- *viṣaya* = an object or thing
- *akṣepī* = transcending or excelling
- *caturthaḥ* = the fourth

The object transcending the inward and outward [movement of the breath] is the fourth.

What is the object that transcends the inward and outward movement of the breath? It is *prana*, the subtle energy for which breath is a metaphor . This subtle meaning of breath is the fourth mode of operation, in addition to the three mentioned previously. The nature of *prana* will be discussed elsewhere.

### Sutra 2.52
*Tataḥ kṣīyate prakāśa-avaraṇam*
- *Tataḥ* = thence, from that
- *kṣīyate* = to diminish, cause to waste away
- *prakāśa* = bright, shining; light
- *avaraṇam* = covering, concealing

From that, the covering of [the inner] light falls away.

By the inner light is meant the spiritual light that represents the *param-atma*, the supreme soul or the soul of the universe, and which is present in all beings as *jiva-atma*, the individual soul. the author is stating that the yogi develops the ability to see this light through *pranayama*. This should be understood as a form of meditation practice that requires no other method except for *pranayama*.

### Sutra 2.53
*Dhāraṇāsu ca yogyatā manasaḥ*
- *Dhāraṇāsu* = for dharana
- *ca yogyatā manasaḥ* = and fitness of the mind

And [the yogi acquires] fitness of the mind for *dharana*.

The author is stating another benefit of *pranayama*, which is fitness of the mind for concentration. By this is meant the calming of the mind, slowing down the constant churning of thoughts, of sense impressions, and the desire for the enjoyment of the senses. The yogi must calm the mind in order to gain the ability to focus. This is accomplished through *pranayama*.

### Perspective
In the *pranayama* described here, the yogi must be seated comfortably and relaxed. The limbs and the senses are brought to a state of being still through *asana*. Then the yogi can begin to focus on the breath, and when he is ready, to interrupt its movement. At first, *kumbhaka* may be momentary, simply noting the point at which one movement of the breath ends and the next begins. With practice it can be lengthened as desired. 

In modern yoga practices, *pranayama* is sometimes done along with *asanas*. The different *asanas* can be used to direct *prana* to various parts of the body. This is said to be accomplished through *nadis*, which are passageways through which *prana* can flow. This is analogous to the nervous system, the circulatory system, the digestive system, etc. In this type of *pranayama*, the yogi in *asana* must be relaxed enough so that he becomes aware of and takes control of his breathing. The movement of the breath is coordinated with movements of the body, and when the *asana* becomes still, focus shifts to the breath. In this type of *pranayama*, the movement of the breath is not interrupted or stopped.
