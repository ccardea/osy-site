### Sutra 2.49
*Tasmin-sati śvāsa-praśvāsayor-gati-vicchedaḥ prāṇāyāmaḥ*
- *Tasmin-sati* = when this is achieved
- *śvā-sa* = Breathing, breath, respiration: breath moving in
- *pra-śvā-sayor* = breath, respiration: breath moving out
- *gati* = motion, going, moving
- *vicchedaḥ* = cutting, breaking, interrupting
- *prāṇāyāma* is being defined here

When this is achieved [the yogi should practice] *prāṇāyāma*, [which is] interrupting the motion of the breath coming in and going out.

When this has been achieved refers to becoming steady and relaxed in asana. Interrupting the motion of the breath seems to refer to the practice known as *kumbhaka*, or stopping the movement of breath either at the end of inhalation or the end of exhalation. Patanjali defines *pranayama* in terms of *kumbhaka*, which gives the sense that he regarded *kumbhaka* as important. 

Caution! Well respected teachers have said that this should not be attempted until basic inhalation and exhalation practices have been mastered.  

An alternative explanation is that Patanjali is not referring to *kumbhaka*, but simply to interrupting the natural, automatic flow of the breath and taking conscious control.

### Sutra 2.50
*bāhya-abhyantara-stambha-vṛttir-deśa-kāla-saṅkhyābhiḥ paridṛṣṭo dīrgha-sūkṣmaḥ*
- *bāhya-abhyantara-stambha-vṛttir* = it's modes of operation are outward, inward, and fixed
- *deśa-kāla-saṅkhyābhiḥ* = place, time, and number
- *paridṛṣṭo* = to appear or become visible: observed
- *dīrgha* = of long duration
- *sūkṣmaḥ* = subtle; small

Its [the breath] modes of operation are outward, inward, and fixed, when observed by place, time, and number, [it becomes] long and subtle. 

There are differing explanations of this sutra. The simple and seemingly obvious one is that the three modes of operation refer to inhalation, exhalation, and kumbhaka. The older, more traditional translators are adamant that this is not the case, that inward and outward refers to the places where kumbhaka is performed, and that *stambha* is not kumbhaka but a practice of suppressing the breath in which breathing is sometimes suspended for long periods of time. There are elaborate practices built around this, which will not be covered here.

Likewise, there are differing explanations as to the meaning of place, time, and number. There are other Hindu texts that refer to stopping the breath in different places. Based on that, breath can be understood as a metaphor for *prana* or energy, which can be consciously directed to various parts of the body. Breath can also be stopped physically in different places, such as chest, ribs, and diaphragm.

### Sutra 2.51
*bāhya-abhyantara-viṣaya-akṣepī caturthaḥ*
- *bāhya-abhyantara* = inward and outward
- *viṣaya* = an object or thing
- *akṣepī* = transcending or excelling
- *caturthaḥ* = the fourth

The object transcending the inward and outward [movement of the breath] is the fourth.

What is the object that transcends the inward and outward movement of the breath? It is *prana*, energy that was discussed in the previous sutra. This subtle meaning of breath is the fourth mode of operation, in addition to the three mentioned previously. The nature of *prana* will be discussed elsewhere.

### Sutra 2.52
*Tataḥ kṣīyate prakāśa-avaraṇam*
- *Tataḥ* = thence, from that
- *kṣīyate* = to diminish, cause to waste away
- *prakāśa* = bright, shining; light
- *avaraṇam* = covering, concealing

From that, the covering of [the inner] light is diminished.

### Sutra 2.53
*Dhāraṇāsu ca yogyatā manasaḥ*
- *Dhāraṇāsu* = for dharana
- *ca yogyatā manasaḥ* = and fitness of the mind

And [the yogi acquires] fitness of the mind for dharana
