title: Pranayama - Observing the Breath

### Sutra 2.49
*Tasmin-sati śvāsa-praśvāsayor-gati-vicchedaḥ prāṇāyāmaḥ*
- *Tasmin-sati* = when this is achieved
- *śvā-sa* = Breathing, breath, respiration: breath moving in
- *pra-śvā-sayor* = breath, respiration: breath moving out
- *gati* = motion, going, moving
- *vicchedaḥ* = cutting, breaking, interrupting
- *prāṇāyāma* is being defined here

#### Translation
When this is achieved [the yogi should practice] *prāṇāyāma*, [which is] interrupting the motion of the breath coming in and going out.

When this has been achieved refers to becoming steady and relaxed in asana. Interrupting the motion of the breath refers to the practice known as *kumbhaka*, or stopping the movement of breath. Well respected teachers have said that kumbhaka should not be attempted until basic inhalation and exhalation practices have been mastered. However, Patanjali defines *pranayama* in terms of *kumbhaka*, which means that he regarded it as important. There s nothing to fear from momentarily stopping the movement of the breath, but it does take experience to know when and for how long to do it.

### Sutra 2.50
*bāhya-abhyantara-stambha-vṛttir-deśa-kāla-saṅkhyābhiḥ paridṛṣṭo dīrgha-sūkṣmaḥ*
- *bāhya-abhyantara-stambha-vṛttir* = its modes of operation are outward, inward, and fixed
- *deśa-kāla-saṅkhyābhiḥ* = place, time, and number
- *paridṛṣṭo* = to appear or become visible: observed
- *dīrgha* = of long duration
- *sūkṣmaḥ* = subtle; small

#### Translation 
Its [the breath's] modes of operation are outward, inward, and fixed, when observed by place, time, and number, [it becomes] long and subtle. 

There are differing explanations of this sutra. The simple and seemingly obvious one is that the three modes of operation refer to inhalation, exhalation, and *kumbhaka*. The older, more traditional translators are adamant that this is not the case, that inward and outward refers to the places where *kumbhaka* is performed, and that *stambha* is not *kumbhaka* but a practice of suppressing the breath in which breathing is sometimes suspended for long periods of time.

Likewise, there are differing explanations as to the meaning of place. Physically, breath can be stopped  in different parts of the lungs, such as diaphragm, rib cage, and the upper part of the lungs. There are other Hindu texts that refer to stopping the breath in different places. Based on that, breath can be understood as a metaphor for *prana* or energy, which can be consciously directed to various parts of the body. 

Time is generally understood to mean the relative amount of time spent in inhalation and exhalation, and is usually thought of as lengthening or shortening the breath. Number is sometimes understood to be the number of repetitions of a particular breathing exercise. It is common practice to measure the amount of time that asanas are held by the number of breaths taken while in the pose. 

When breath is observed as prescribed it becomes "long and subtle". This is a benchmark for the yogi to evaluate his/her practice. When the breath becomes long and subtle, the yogi can be confident that he/she is practicing correctly.

### Sutra 2.51
*bāhya-abhyantara-viṣaya-akṣepī caturthaḥ*
- *bāhya-abhyantara* = inward and outward
- *viṣaya* = an object or thing
- *akṣepī* = transcending or excelling
- *caturthaḥ* = the fourth

The object transcending the inward and outward [movement of the breath] is the fourth.

What is the object that transcends the inward and outward movement of the breath? It is *prana*, the subtle energy for which breath is a metaphor . This subtle meaning of breath is the fourth mode of operation, in addition to the three mentioned previously. The nature of *prana* will be discussed elsewhere.

### Sutra 2.52
*Tataḥ kṣīyate prakāśa-avaraṇam*
- *Tataḥ* = thence, from that
- *kṣīyate* = to diminish, cause to waste away
- *prakāśa* = bright, shining; light
- *avaraṇam* = covering, concealing

From that, the covering of [the inner] light falls away.

By the inner light is meant the spiritual light that represents the *param-atma*, the supreme soul or the soul of the universe, and which is present in all beings as *jiva-atma*, the individual soul. the author is stating that the yogi develops the ability to see this light through *pranayama*. This should be understood as a form of meditation practice that requires no other method except for *pranayama*.

### Sutra 2.53
*Dhāraṇāsu ca yogyatā manasaḥ*
- *Dhāraṇāsu* = for dharana
- *ca yogyatā manasaḥ* = and fitness of the mind

And [the yogi acquires] fitness of the mind for *dharana*.

The author is stating another benefit of *pranayama*, which is fitness of the mind for concentration. Fitness for concentration means calming the mind, slowing down the constant churning of thoughts, of sense impressions, and the desire for the enjoyment of the senses. The yogi must calm the mind in order to gain the ability to concentrate. This is accomplished through *pranayama*.

### Perspective
In the *pranayama* described here, the yogi must be comfortable and relaxed. The limbs and the senses are brought to a state of being still through *asana*. Then the yogi can begin to observe the breath, and when he is ready, to interrupt its movement. At first, *kumbhaka* may be momentary, simply noting the point at which one movement of the breath ends and the next begins. With practice it can be lengthened as desired.
