title: Pratyahara - The Practice

A [previous article](https://old-school-yoga.org/yoga/pratyahara.html) discussed the definition of Pratyahara that is found in the Yoga Sutras. If you have not read that article, you should do so before continuing on with this one. This article discusses in detail the practice of Pratyahara as it is described in the Jabala Darsana Upanishad.

### From Jabala Darsana Upanishad
>Apart from this, inhaling air(oxygen) and stopping It in different places is also Pratyahara. The wise man would sit in Swasthikasana, draw his breath till it fills up from head to toe and hold it in two feet, muladhara, stomach, middle of the eyelids, forehead and at the top of the skull. Then he should leave out the belief that the body is oneself and make that thought nirvikalpa and merge it with Paramatma. The experts in Vedanta say that this is true Pratyahara. There is nothing that cannot be attained by those who practice like this.  

#### Inhaling air and stopping it
According to the Upanishad, pratyahara is performed along with asana and pranayama. There is no mention of any particular form of pranayama, just a full breath and kumbhaka. 

#### The wise man would sit in Swasthikasana
This is more of a suggestion than a rule. It suggests that the entire practice can be performed while in a single seated asana, but this is not a requirement. The individual yogi or yoga teacher should use his or her own best judgement. The particular asana(s) to be used are dictated by the other requirements of the practice. They need to be something that the yogi can relax into and stay in long enough to perform kumbhaka and the internal practice.

#### Stopping the breath in different places
Physically, the breath cannot be stopped anywhere other than different parts of the lungs or at particular points in the breathing cycle. For the most part, stopping the breath in various places should be understood as performing kumbhaka while attention is focused on, or prana is directed to, different parts of the body. 

In Jabala Darsana, attention is focused on a combination of physical limbs, internal organs, and chakras. This particular sequence may be useful but is an imperfect enumeration of indriyas. The practice can be modified to use the Samkhya enumeration of indriyas as stated in the previous article, starting with instruments of action and continuing through cognition. Each indriya can be addressed individually or they can be combined.

When each indriya is addressed one by one, the yogi can take time to relax and become aware of sensations in various parts of the body. This is similar to progressive relaxation and interoception techniques used in psychology. As the yogi gains experience, he or she may not always want or need to go through each individual indriya. In fact, the yogi may want to develop skill such that awareness of the indriyas can be achieved quickly, so that the yogi can move forward with his or her practice. It is possible to bring awareness to both arms and legs at the same time in asana. When focus shifts to breathing, it is possible to briefly note reproduction, elimination, and speech in a single breath using bandhas.

#### Leave out the belief that the body is oneself
This is an important part of the internal practice that goes beyond progressive relaxation and interoception. It raises the question: if I am not my body, then what am I? The answer from the Katha Upanishad is, know the self to be the master of the chariot.

#### Make that thought nirvikalpa
Recall from sutra 1.6 that vikalpa is one of the five citta vrtti. Patanjali defined it as verbal knowledge without an underlying object. Nirvikalpa means the opposite of vikalpa. To make “that thought” nirvikalpa, the yogi must shift focus from the mere idea to the actual underlying reality. He or she must become the master of the chariot. This is where the real work happens.

#### Merge it with Paramatma
In the final stage of the practice, the yogi realizes the self as part of something larger. In Hindu thought, there is a concept of jiva-atma and param-atma. Jiva-atma is the embodied self or individual soul, while param-atma is the supreme self, the soul of the world that encompasses all of the jivas. Similar concepts are found in Samkhya philosophy and in Christianity. 

In this article, we have referred to jivatma as the master of the chariot. Note that jivatma and paramatma are different from the ultimate self that is the end goal of all yoga.

### Next Steps
The practice described here can be effective at getting the yogi deeper into his or her practice. It is certainly an exercise in mental discipline, but as stated before, the real work consists of actually becoming the master of the chariot, the yogi who is discriminative and possesses a mind that is under control at all times. Toward that end, there is more to learn about the nature of the mind and what it means to be discriminative.
