### Sutra 2.32 
The *niyamas* are:
- *Śauca* = Cleansing, purifying
- *santoṣa* = contentment
- *tapaḥ* = austerity
- *svādhyāya* = study of scriptures, chanting of mantras
- *iśvara-praṇidhāna* = devotion to isvara, the supreme being or god

### *Śauca* - Purification

#### Sutra 2.40
*Śaucāt-sva-aṅga-jugupsā parair-asaṁsargaḥ*
- *Śaucāt* = purity, purification, cleansing,
- *sva-aṅga* = ones own limbs or members
- *jugupsā* = dislike, aversion, disgust
- *parair-asaṁsargaḥ* = non-association with others 

Through purification, [the yogi develops] aversion to his own body [and the desire for] non-association with others. 

Through the practice of yoga, the yogi begins to lessen the desire for gratification of the senses. The desire for non-association flows naturally from the desire to cure old bad habits. There are different degrees of this. The most extreme is the ascetic who lives alone and prefers to maintain a solitary existence. More common are monks and others who live in communities with other like-minded individuals. Even among these there are different degrees of isolation from the outside world. In secular society it is found in people who are recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, who are advised to cut off their association with others who are still actively involved in their vices.

#### Sutra 2.41
*Sattva-śuddhi-saumanasya-aikagrya-indriya-jaya-atma-darśana-yogyatvāni ca* 
- *Sattva* = goodness, virtue, excellence; one of the three *guna*
- *śuddhi* = purity, cleanness
- *saumanasya* = satisfaction of mind, pleasure, delight
- *aikagrya* = intentness on one object
- *indriya-jaya* = conquest or subjugation of the senses
- *atma* =  the self, soul
- *darśana* = seeing; knowing, perceiving; discernment, understanding
- *yogyatvāni* = ability
- *ca* = and

[Through] purity of *sattva*, [the yogi gains] a calm mind, and the ability to concentrate, to subdue the senses, and to know the *atma*. 

*Sattva* requires explanation. In the world view that was common when the Sutras were written, it is one of the three *guna* or qualities that exist throughout material nature:
- *Sattva* = lightness or illumination
- *Rajas* = activity, evolution, and constant change
- *Tamas* = heaviness, darkness, and inertia

The *guna* are said to combine in different proportions to produce the various forms of nature. It may be helpful to think of *sattva* and *tamas* as opposite ends of a spectrum, such as good and evil or light and darkness. The activity of *rajas* can vary both along the spectrum of tamas to sattva, and also in a range from low to high.

In the current context, the harmful impulses, thoughts, and actions related to lust, anger, and greed are *tamas*. The yogi needs to adjust his thoughts and control his impulses toward the *sattva* end of the spectrum. When he does that he starts to realize the benefits of calm mind, etc. These read like the steps of a ladder that the yogi is climbing. Note: *sattva* can never be completely pure. The three *guna* are said to be inseparable, and all three are always present to some degree.

### *Santoṣa* - Contentment

#### Sutra 2.42
*Santoṣad-anuttama-sukha-lābhaḥ*
- *Santoṣa* = contentment
- *anuttama* = unsurpassed, the very best or highest
- *sukha* = happiness, joy
- *lābhaḥ* = gaining, obtaining

Through contentment, [he gains] unsurpassed happiness.

No explanation or elaboration required, only contemplation.

### *Tapaḥ* -  Austerity

#### Sutra 2.43
*Kāya-indriya-siddhir-aśuddhi-kṣaya-attapasaḥ*  
- *Kāya-indriya-siddhir* = perfection of the body and the senses
- *aśuddhi-kṣayat* = the diminishing of impurity
- *tapasaḥ* = from austerity

From austerity, [he gains] perfection of the body and the senses and the diminishing of impurity.

What kinds of austerity bring about perfection of the body and the senses? Surely not things like fasting, subjecting oneself to extremes of hot and cold, etc. One good example is getting up early in the morning to practice yoga.

### *Svādhyāya* - Chanting of Mantras

#### Sutra 2.44
*Svādhyayād-iṣṭa-devatā-samprayogaḥ*  
- *Svādhyayād* = from chanting of mantras
- *iṣṭa-devatā* = the desired deity
- *samprayogaḥ* = union, connection, meeting, contact

From chanting of mantras, [he gains] contact with the desired deity.

*Svadhyaya* has a few different meanings. It is sometimes translated as self-study, and people derive all sorts of meaning from that. *Svadhyaya* can also refer to the practice of memorizing and reciting scriptures for the purpose of transmitting them to others that was used before writing was commonplace. Here, *svadhyaya* refers to the chanting of mantras that are associated with specific deities. This type of practice is common in Buddhism but is usually omitted by western yoga practitioners. Compared to *Isvara*, the *ista-devata* are lesser deities.

### *Iśvara-praṇidhāna* - Devotion to Isvara

#### Sutra 2.45
*Samādhi-siddhir-īśvara-praṇidhānāt*  
- *Samādhi* = the highest of the 8 limbs
- *siddhir* = Accomplishment, fulfillment, completion, perfection, complete attainment (of an object)
- *īśvara* = the lord
- *praṇidhānāt* = profound religious meditation

From *Isvara-pranidhana*, [the yogi] attains *samadhi*.

The explanation of *Isvara* and *Isvara-pranidhana* is given in Yoga Sutras chapter one, and is presented here in abbreviated form.

##### Sutra 1.23
*Īśvara-praṇidhānād-vā*

In Sutra 1.23 *Isvara-pranidhana* is introduced with the word *va*, meaning "or". This implies that *isvara-pranidhana* is being offered as an alternative to the more detailed methods of *samadhi* described in the *Jnana* portion of the Sutras.

The sutras go on to describe some characteristics of Isvara:   

##### Sutra 1.24
- *purusa-visesa* = an individual being having characteristics that are peculiar to him and which make him different from other beings.
- *aparamstra* = in no way connected to [the following]
    - *klesa* = pain, anguish, trouble or affliction; the causes of pain, etc.
    - *karma-vipaka* = action and its consequences; he does not participate in birth, life, death, and rebirth.
    - *asaya* = resting place, abode; he does not incarnate.

##### Sutra 1.25
- *sarva-jna-bijam* = having the seed of all-knowing; he is omniscient.
- *tatra niratisayam* = he has attained a state that cannot be exceeded or surpassed.

##### Sutra 1.26
- *purvesam-api guruh* = he is teacher even of the ancients.
- *kalena-anavacchedat* = he is not limited by time, that is, he is eternal.

##### Sutra 1.27
- *tasya vacaka* = the special word designating him
- *pranava* = the sacred or mystic syllable, *Om*.

##### Sutra 1.28
- *tad-japas* = repetition of that
- *tad-artha-bhavanam* = its meaning dwelling in the mind

Patanjali has described *isvara-pranidhana* as repetition of the syllable "Om" and contemplation of its meaning.

##### Sutra 1.29
- *tatah pratyak-cetana-adhigamo* = from that, he acquires inward mindedness
- *api-antaraya-abhavas-ca* = and also elimination of obstacles

There is some disagreement among translators regarding the first phrase. Here it is taken to mean changing the consciousness, which is usually directed outward, and directing it inward. The second phrase tells us that, along the way to attaining *samadhi*, *isvara-pranidhana* helps the yogi to overcome obstacles that may be in his/her path. That seems like the same thing as eliminating impurities and it is, but there are differences to what has been discussed in *yama* and *niyama*. This will be discussed elsewhere.

The subject of Isvara is deep and wide. It is often interpreted as referring to Saguna Brahman, the universal unity that is central to Advaita Vedanta, which is the dominant philosophy of Hinduism. The Samkhya-Yoga tradition, of which the Yoga Sutras is a part, describes a different type of Isvara. If the reader is not comfortable with Patanjali's concept of *Isvara*, it is acceptable to substitute his/her own concept of God. Isvara will be discussed at length elsewhere.
