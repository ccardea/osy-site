### Sutra 2.32 
The *niyamas* are:
- *Śauca* = Cleansing, purifying
- *santoṣa* = contentment
- *tapaḥ* = austerity
- *svādhyāya* = study of scriptures, chanting of mantras
- *iśvara-praṇidhāna* = devotion to isvara, the supreme being or god

### *Śauca* - Purification

#### Sutra 2.40
*Śaucāt-sva-aṅga-jugupsā parair-asaṁsargaḥ*
- *Śaucāt* = purity, purification, cleansing,
- *sva-aṅga* = ones own limbs or members
- *jugupsā* = dislike, aversion, disgust
- *parair-asaṁsargaḥ* = non-association with others 

Through purification, [the yogi develops] aversion to his own body [and also, aversion to] association with others. 

The desire for non-association flows naturally from the desire to cure old bad habits. There are different degrees of this. The most extreme is the ascetic who lives alone and prefers to maintain a solitary existence. More common are monks and others who live in communities with other like-minded individuals. Even among these there are different degrees of isolation from the outside world. In secular society it is found in people who are recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, who are advised to cut off their association with others who are still actively involved in their vices.

#### Sutra 2.41
*Sattva-śuddhi-saumanasya-aikagrya-indriya-jaya-atma-darśana-yogyatvāni ca* 
- *Sattva* = goodness, virtue, excellence; one of the three *guna*
- *śuddhi* = purity, cleanness
- *saumanasya* = satisfaction of mind, pleasure, delight
- *aikagrya* = intentness on one object
- *indriya-jaya* = conquest or subjugation of the senses
- *atma* =  the self, soul
- *darśana* = seeing; knowing, perceiving; discernment, understanding
- *yogyatvāni* = ability
- *ca* = and

[Through] purity of *sattva*, [the yogi gains] a calm mind, and the ability to concentrate, to subdue the senses, and to know the *atma*. 

*Sattva* requires explanation. It is one of the three *guna* or qualities that exist throughout material nature:
- *Sattva* = lightness or illumination
- *Rajas* = activity and constant change
- *Tamas* = heaviness, darkness, and inertia

The *guna* are said to combine in different proportions to produce the various forms of nature. It may be helpful to think of *sattva* and *tamas* as opposite ends of a spectrum, with *rajas* forming a third dimension. Activity can vary both along the spectrum of tamas to sattva, and also along its own dimension, low, medium, and high.

The yogi needs to adjust his thinking and action toward the *sattva* end of the spectrum. When he does that he starts to realize the benefits of calm mind, etc. These read like the steps of a ladder that the yogi is climbing.

*Atma* should be thought of as the soul. The self has a specific meaning in Samkhya-Yoga and to call *atma* the self creates confusion with that concept. The Upanishads contain the concept of *jivatma*, the individual embodied soul, and *paramatma*, the universal soul.

### *Santoṣa* - Contentment

#### Sutra 2.42
*Santoṣad-anuttama-sukha-lābhaḥ*
- *Santoṣa* = contentment
- *anuttama* = unsurpassed, the very best or highest
- *sukha* = happiness, joy
- *lābhaḥ* = gaining, obtaining

Through contentment, he gains unsurpassed happiness.

### *Tapaḥ* -  Austerity

#### Sutra 2.43
*Kāya-indriya-siddhir-aśuddhi-kṣaya-attapasaḥ*  
- *Kāya-indriya-siddhir* = perfection of the body and the senses
- *aśuddhi-kṣayat* = the diminishing of impurity
- *tapasaḥ* = from austerity

From austerity, [he gains] perfection of the body and the senses and diminishing of impurity.

### *Svādhyāya* - Study of Scriptures, Chanting of Mantras

#### Sutra 2.44
*Svādhyayād-iṣṭa-devatā-samprayogaḥ*  
- *Svādhyayād* = from chanting of mantras
- *iṣṭa-devatā* = the desired deity
- *samprayogaḥ* = union, connection, meeting, contact

From chanting of mantras, [he gains] contact with the desired deity

### *Iśvara-praṇidhāna* - Devotion to Isvara

#### Sutra 2.45
*Samādhi-siddhir-īśvara-praṇidhānāt*  
- *Samādhi* = the highest of the 8 limbs
- *siddhir* = Accomplishment, fulfilment, completion, perfection, complete attainment (of an object)
- *īśvara* = the lord, the most high god
- *praṇidhānāt* = profound religious meditation

From *Isvara-pranidhana*, [the yogi] attains *samadhi*.
