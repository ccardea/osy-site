title: Jnana + Yoga = Yoga Sutras

#### Yoga Sikha Upanishad 1.2
>Some people say that the only way out is Jnana (knowledge). To attain occult powers, that alone will not suffice. How can Jnana without Yoga lead to salvation? It is also true that Yoga alone without Jnana will not lead to salvation. So the one who aims at salvation, should learn Jnana and Yoga together. 

The Yoga Sutras represents the combination of Jnana and Yoga. Large portions of the text are concerned with acquiring and perfecting knowledge, and not only ordinary knowledge but also knowledge that leads to higher consciousness and self-realization. Old School Yoga regards the Jnana portions as generally not well understood in traditional translations. Correct understanding can be obtained only by careful analysis of the text. 

I have been working on such an analysis and the results have been far beyond my expectations. I believe I may have uncovered an understanding of this material that has been lost for some time. While it has taken me years to come to this understanding, when explained properly, it is not difficult to understand. I do not claim to have mastered all of the techniques that are described, only to have uncovered the knowledge. I'm excited to pass this knowledge on to others in the hope that some will not only master it, but achieve great things in the process.
