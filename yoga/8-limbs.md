title: Introduction To The 8 Limbs (Asta-Anga) Yoga
---
### Sutra 2.28
*Yoga-aṅga-anuṣṭhānād-aśuddhi-kṣaye jñāna-dīptir-āviveka-khyāteḥ*
- *yoga* = yoga
- *aṅga* = a limb or member of the body
- *anuṣṭhānā* = doing, performance, practice, execution, accomplishment
- *aśuddhi* =  Impurity, foulness
- *kṣaye* = loss, decline, waste, wane, decay, diminution; destruction, end, termination
- *jñāna* = knowing, understanding; knowledge, learning; knowledge derived from meditation on the higher truths of religion and philosophy
- *dīptir* = brightness, splendour, brilliance, lustre
- *ā* = near, near to, towards, from all sides, all around
- *viveka* = discrimination, judgment, discernment, discretion
- *khyāteḥ* = (In phil.) Knowledge, the faculty of discriminating objects by appropriate designation

#### Translation
By practicing the limbs of yoga, [and with] the elimination of impurity, [there arises] the illumination of understanding leading to discernment [of self from not-self] by the faculty of discrimination.

#### Discussion
The ability to differentiate the self and the not-self by the faculty of discrimination is the end game of the ancient yoga practice. When the yogi can do this continuously, then he abides in his own-form. The important points are: 
1. The limbs of yoga are the methods. They are concerned with
1. Elimination of impurity, and
1. Illumination of understanding. 

### Sutra 2.29
*Yama-niyama-asana-prāṇāyāma-pratyāhāra-dhāraṇā-dhyāna-samādhayo' ṣṭā-vaṅgāni*

#### Translation
The Eight Limbs (*ṣṭā-vaṅgāni*) are: 
- *yama* - restraints
- *niyama* - observances
- *asana* - postures
- *prāṇāyāma* - breath control
- *pratyāhāra* - withdrawal from sense objects
- *dhāraṇā* - concentration on one point
- *dhyāna* - one-pointedness
- *samādhi* - clarity of perception at the most subtle level

#### Discussion
The eight limbs can be classified as:
- Elimination of Impurity
    - yama
    - niyama
    - dhyana
- Physical Practices
    - asana
    - pranayama
    - pratyahara
- Illumination of Understanding
    - pratyahara
    - dharana
    - dhyana
    - samadhi

Pratyahara is the transition from the outside world of the senses to the internal world of the mind, and appears in two categories. Dhyana is explained as illumination of understanding, but used for elimination of impurities.
