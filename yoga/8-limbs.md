title: Introduction To The 8 Limbs (Asta-Anga) Yoga
---
### Sutra 2.28
*Yoga-aṅga-anuṣṭhānād-aśuddhi-kṣaye jñāna-dīptir-āviveka-khyāteḥ*
- *yoga* = yoga
- *aṅga* = a limb or member of the body
- *anuṣṭhānā* = doing, performance, practice, execution, accomplishment
- *aśuddhi* =  Impurity, foulness
- *kṣaye* = loss, decline, waste, wane, decay, diminution; destruction, end, termination
- *jñāna* = knowing, understanding; knowledge, learning; knowledge derived from meditation on the higher truths of religion and philosophy
- *dīptir* = brightness, splendour, brilliance, lustre
- *ā* = near, near to, towards, from all sides, all around
- *viveka* = discrimination, judgment, discernment, discretion
- *khyāteḥ* = (In phil.) Knowledge, the faculty of discriminating objects by appropriate designation

#### Translation
By practicing the limbs of yoga, [and with] the elimination of impurity, [there arises] the illumination of understanding leading to discernment [of self from not-self] by the faculty of discrimination.

#### Discussion
The ability to differentiate the self and the not-self by the faculty of discrimination is the end game of the ancient yoga practice. Following this, the yogi gets the power of awareness in his own form. The important points are: 
1. The limbs of yoga are the methods. They are concerned with
1. Elimination of impurity, and
1. Illumination of understanding.
