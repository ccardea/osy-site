title: Introduction To The 8 Limbs (Asta-Anga) Yoga
---
### Sutra 2.28
*Yoga-aṅga-anuṣṭhānād-aśuddhi-kṣaye jñāna-dīptir-āviveka-khyāteḥ*
- *yoga = yoga
- *aṅga* = a limb or member of the body
- *anuṣṭhānā* = doing, performance, practice, execution, accomplishment
- *aśuddhi* =  Impurity, foulness
- *kṣaye* = loss, decline, waste, wane, decay, diminution; destruction, end, termination
- *jñāna* = knowing, understanding; knowledge, learning; knowledge derived from meditation on the higher truths of religion and philosophy
- *dīptir* = brightness, splendour, brilliance, lustre
- *ā* = near, near to, towards, from all sides, all around
- *viveka* = discrimination, judgment, discernment, discretion
- *khyāteḥ* = (In phil.) Knowledge, the faculty of discriminating objects by appropriate designation

#### Translation
By practicing the limbs of yoga, [and with] the elimination of impurity, [there arises] the illumination of understanding leading to discernment [of self from not-self] by the faculty of discrimination.

#### Discussion
The ability to discern the self from the not-self by the faculty of discrimination is the end game of the ancient yoga practice. It is a complex concept that beginning students need not concern themselves with. The important points are that practicing the limbs of yoga is the path that gets the yogi to that point, and this occurs through the "illumination of understanding". 

We will find that the 8 limbs fall into three categories:  
1. Physical practices,
1. Those that bring about the elimination of impurities, and
1. Those that bring about the illumination of understanding.

#### Note
Beginning students should become accustomed to reading sanskrit words and their definitions. It is standard practice for this kind of text to present it as has been done here, defining each word or sometimes combinations of words. This is done to ensure the integrity of the text and the translation. Familiarity with the sanskrit is often helpful when dealing with words that don't translate easily to English, or with difficult concepts. There is not too much of that in this section of the sutras. In order to reduce complexity for beginners, we may dispense with that convention when possible, or use it when it is helpful.
