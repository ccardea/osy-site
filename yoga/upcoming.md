### More Yoga content is on the way!

#### The Hidden Meaning of the Yoga Sutras
Will be discussing the *jnana* portion of the Yoga Sutras, which has not been well understood by traditional translators.

#### Graded Courses
These will be presenting more details of the yoga practices that were covered in the beginner material, along with other material that was not covered there. They will be structured so as not to overwhelm the student with material that he/she is not ready for.

### Elsewhere On This Website

#### Samkhya
Next up is the beginner Samkhya material. Understanding this material is necessary for the more advanced yoga practices. 

#### Kundalini
Some material will be published here to give yogis the necessary background for Kundalini practice.
