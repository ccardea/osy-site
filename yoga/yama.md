### Sutra 2.30
The *yama* are:  
- *ahiṁsā* = not-harming,
- *satya* = truthfulness,
- *asteya* = not-stealing,
- *brahmacarya* = continence,
- *aparigrahā* = *apari* - the opposite of *graha* - grasping, greed, avarice

#### Application
In contemplating the various forms of *yama*, the reader should attempt to identify not only the obvious forms of harmful acts, but also more subtle forms. Short examples are provided. 

### Sutra 2.31
*Jāti-deśa-kāla-samaya-anavacchinnāḥ sārva-bhaumā mahā-vratam*
- *jāti* = birth; the form of existence fixed by birth; A caste, tribe or class (of men)
- *deśa* = place
- *kāla* = time
- *samaya* = occasion, opportunity; a fit time; usual practice
- *anavacchinnāḥ* = not bounded; unmodified; here: without regard tp
- *sārva-bhaumā* = *sārva* - all + *bhaumā* - earthly, terrestrial; here: universal 
- *mahā* = great
- *vratam* = vow

[*Yama*] constitute the great vow, [which] is universal [and applicable] without regard to time, place, class, or usual practice.

*Samaya*, or usual practice, requires some explanation. The usual practice of military men, for example, is to engage in violence and killing of others. Some upper echelon or highly placed people may engage in practices that ordinarily would be considered harmful to others, but are the usual practice for people in their position. 

*Maha-vratam*, the great vow, implies that the yogi must commit to these principles.

### Ahimsa - not-harming
- Obvious forms: violence, killing.
- Subtle forms: harming oneself. 

#### Sutra 2.35
*Ahiṁsā-pratiṣṭhāyāṁ tat-sannidhau vaira-tyāgaḥ*
- *Ahiṁsā-pratiṣṭhāyāṁ* = to be established in *ahimsa*
- *tat-sannidhau* = coming near to him, in his presence
- *vaira-tyāgaḥ* = abandoning of hostility

When established in *ahimsa*, hostility is abandoned in his presence. 

This is perhaps best illustrated by leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King, who used non-violence to overcome opposition to their causes. It can also be seen in animals who are kept on a farm or in a zoo. When they learn that people are not a threat to them, they become more tame.

### *Satya* - truthfulness
Obvious forms: lying to escape trouble or obtain an undeserved benefit.  
Subtle forms: being honest with oneself, intellectual honesty.

#### Sutra 2.36
*Satya-pratiṣṭhāyāṁ kriyā-phala-aśrayatvam*
- *Satya-pratiṣṭhāyāṁ* = to be established in truthfulness
- *kriyā* = action
- *phala* = fruit
- *aśrayatvam* = that on which anything depends or rests

When established in truthfulness, fruit [of action] depends on [the yogi's own] action.

In modern terms, this is known as taking responsibility for one's actions. The yogi does not make excuses or blame others for his circumstances, but realizes that they are the result of his own actions. This is not always easy. 

Some traditional translators interpret the sutra to mean that the yogi becomes infallible, but this has been rejected by modern scholars.

### *Asteya* - not stealing
Obvious forms: not taking anything that doesn't belong to you.   
Subtle forms: putting in a good day's work for your employer.

#### Sutra 2.37
*Asteya-pratiṣṭhāyāṁ sarva-ratna-upasthānam*
- *Asteya-pratiṣṭhāyāṁ* = to be established in not-stealing
- *sarva* = all
- *ratna* = A gem, jewel, a precious stone; anything valuable or precious
- *upasthānam* = coming into the presence of;

When established in not stealing, all precious things come into his presence.

This appears to be Patanjali's take on Divine Providence. When the yogi is committed to not stealing, the things that he needs come to him.

### *Brahmacarya* - continence
Obvious forms: celibacy, abstaining from sex.  
Subtle forms: appropriate behavior with members of the opposite sex.

#### Sutra 2.38
*Brahmacarya-pratiṣṭhāyāṁ vīrya-lābhaḥ*  
- *Brahmacarya-pratiṣṭhāyāṁ* = to be established in *brahmacharya*
- *vīrya* = vigor, strength, virility, potency
- *lābhaḥ* = gaining, obtaining, acquisition

When esablished in *brahmacharya* he acquires vigor.

This is written from the male point of view and females may question its validity for them. For males, this is a well known principle that is practiced by athletes, military, and others.

### *Aparigrahā* - absence of greed, greedlessness
Obvious forms: Not being consumed by acquisition of money.  
Subtle forms: Seeking rewards but lacking in the effort required to obtain them.

#### Sutra 2.39
*Aparigraha-sthairye janma-kathantā-sambodhaḥ*
- *Aparigraha* = absence of greed
- *sthairye* = firmness, steadiness, stability
- *janman* = birth; origin; life, existence
- *kathantā* = What sort or manner
- *sambodhaḥ* = Explaining, instructing, informing; Full or correct perception 

When firm in absence of greed, [the yogi] correctly perceives the manner of his existence. 

This sutra is difficult to comprehend. Some translators read it as the yogi acquires knowledge of previous births, but it's difficult to see a cause and effect relation to greedlessness. The problematic phrase is *janma-kathantā*. What is meant by "the manner of his existence"? Suppose a man is born economically disadvantaged, but wants to work only in the highest paying jobs. He does not understand that his background will not permit him to work in those kinds of jobs, because he simply has no opportunity to acquire the necessary skills. It is only by abandoning his inappropriate aspirations that he can begin to understand what is possible for him.
