title: Asta Anga (8 Limbs) Yoga
---
The Eight Limbs or Asta-Anga Yoga are common to both Samkhya-Yoga and the yoga of the Upanishads. A few different versions can be found in the Upanishads, but the scheme laid out in the Yoga Sutras has become the standard. 

This page contains a summary of the Eight Limbs, with links to more details.

### Yamas and Niyama
The Yamas and Niyamas are the yogi's code of conduct. Living according to these principles will lead to tranquility in one's life that is conducive to the practice of yoga. Conversely, violating the principles will bring turmoil that will be an obstacle. Unlike a religious text, yamas and niyamas aren't presented as a moral code, but as the forces of nature. If you behave in a certain way, good things happen, and vice-versa. It's just the way things are. 

Each of the 5 yamas and 5 niyamas has at least one sutra explaining its benefits, in total eighteen sutras for these two limbs. Most of the other limbs have between one and three sutras devoted to them. From this, we can infer that the author considered yamas and niyamas to be of great importance.

#### Yamas (Restraints) YS 2.30
- *ahimsa* - non-harming
- *satya* - truthfulness
- *asteya* - non-stealing
- *brahmacharya* - self-control or sexual abstinence
- *aparigraha* - greedlessness

#### Niyamas (Observances) YS 2.31
- *sauca* - cleanliness, purification. [*2.40-41*](/yoga/sutras/2-40-41.html)
- *samtosa* - contentment
- *tapas* - austerity, physical and mental discipline [*2-43*](/yoga/sutras/2-43.html)
- *svadhyaya* - self study, study which leads to knowledge of the self 
- *isvara pranidhana* - devotion to Isvara (the Lord)

### Asana YS 2.46 - 48
Asana is posture, the familiar yoga postures that are performed all over the world. The Yoga Sutras does not emphasize skill at physical postures. It says only that asana should be *sthira* (steady) and *sukha* (joyful, agreeable, comfortable). This is often thought of as seated posture or savasana, but can also be interpreted as referring to any posture in which the yogi can be steady and comfortable.

### Pranayama YS 2.49 - 53
Once the yogi has become steady and comfortable, *pranayama* (breath control) can begin. Patanjali describes pranayama in terms of *kumbhaka* or the pause between inhalation and exhalation, but does not prescribe any other particular technique of pranayama. He describes regulating breath according to:
- place - the place in the body where the breath (or vital force) should be directed,
- time - the length of inhalation and exhalation, and
- number - the number of repetitions.

Like asana, pranayama is not an end in itself. Patanjali explicitly states that pranayama makes the mind fit for concentration, placing it in a role of preparing the yogi for further progress. Entire books have been written about the subject and the discussion here is limited. A forthcoming article will discuss four basic types of pranayama.
