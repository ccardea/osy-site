title: Cultivating the Opposites
---
In the original text of the Yoga Sutras, the two sutras presented here come after *yama* and *niyama* have been defined. Here they are presented first in order to emphasize the purpose of *yama* and *niyama*, which is eliminating undesired traits. 

### Sutra 2.33
*Vitarka bādhane pratipakṣa-bhāvanam*  
- *Vitarka* = thinking, reasoning, reflecting
- *bādhane* = oppressing, disturbing
- *pratipakṣa* = contrary, adverse
- *bhāvanam* = creating, manifesting; contemplation

#### Translation
Disturbing thoughts [should be countered by] cultivating the opposites.

### Sutra 2.34
*Vitarkā hiṁsa-adayaḥ kṛta-kārita-anumoditā lobha-krodha-moha-pūrvakā mṛdu-madhya-adhimātrā duḥkha-ajñāna-ananta-phalā iti pratipakṣa-bhāvanam*  
- *Vitarkā* = thoughts, thinking
- *hiṁsa-adayaḥ* = harmful
- *kṛta* = done, performed
- *kārita* = caused to be done or effected
- *anumoditā* = approval, assent
- *lobha* = greed, avarice
- *krodha* = anger
- *moha* = delusion, infatuation;
- *pūrvakā* = preceded by, preceding; arising from
- *mṛdu* = mild
- *madhya* = middle, central
- *adhimātrā* = excessive, inordinate
- *duḥkha* = sorrow, grief, unhappiness
- *ajñāna* = ignorance
- *ananta* = endless, infinite, eternal
- *phalā* = result, fruit, consequence, effect
- *iti* = so, thus, in this manner
- *pratipakṣa* = the opposites
- *bhāvanam* = manifesting or bringing into being

#### Translation
Harmful thinking arising from lust, anger, or greed; whether done, caused to be done, or approved; whether mild, medium, or excessive; results in unending ignorance and sorrow, therefore, the yogi should cultivate the opposites.

### Perspective
Here, Patanjali is explaining why the yogi practices *yama* and *niyama*. The undesired traits that the yogi seeks to eliminate are those harmful thoughts and actions arising from lust, anger, and greed. Elimination is desired because the harmful activities inevitably result in unending ignorance and sorrow. If the yogi engages in things such as violence, lying, stealing, etc., his life is bound to be beset by trouble and sorrow. In these conditions, calming of the *citta-vrrti* is impossible. 

It must be understood that the undesireable conditions resulting from harmful activities are due to the natural forces of karma. They are not thought of as punishments meted out by an offended god. Karma is thought of as operating like the laws of physics, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. 

Patanjali brings out the point that the yogi cannot avoid the unwanted results by simply not getting his own hands dirty. The individual will reap the rewards of his/her actions whether he/she is the  perpetrator, the mastermind, or simply approves. Similarly, reducing the level of participation to just a little bit will not be sufficient. The undesired traits must be eliminated to the greatest possible extent.

The means of elimination is manifesting or bringing into being their opposites. The opposites are *yama* and *niyama*. The manifesting of yama and niyama in the life and thinking of the yogi is the first step in the elimination of undesired traits. Intermediate and advanced steps are described elsewhere in the Sutras.
