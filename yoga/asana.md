### Sutra 2.46
*Sthira-sukham-āsanam*
- *Sthira* = Firm, steady, fixed
- *sukham* = Agreeable, pleasant; Easy practicable; Fit, suitable
- *āsanam* = Sitting down; A seat, place, stool; A particular posture or mode of sitting

*Asana* [should be] steady and comfortable

### Sutra 2.47
*Prayatna-śaithilya-ananta-samāpattibhyām*
- *Prayatna* = Effort, exertion, endeavour
- *śaithilya* = Looseness, laxity, relaxation of rule
- *ananta* = Endless, infinite, eternal, boundless, inexhaustible
- *samāpatti* = Meeting, encountering; assuming an original form

[Accompanied by] relaxation of effort [and] assuming the form of the infinite.

Most translators shy away from the literal meaning of *samapatti* that is used here. Patanjali himself defines *samapatti* as an advanced form of meditation practice (Sutra 1.41). The apparent meaning is that the yogi should relax to the point where he feels that his body has dissolved into or become one with infinity.

### Sutra 2.48
*Tato dvandva-anabhighātaḥ*
- *Tato* = From that (person or place &c.), thence
- *dvandva* = pair, couple; pairs of opposites
- *anabhighātaḥ* = immunity, unassailability,

From that, [the yogi becomes] immune to the pairs of opposites.

### Discussion
It is clear from these three sutras that Patanjali is not talking about the many postures that are used in modern yoga practices. He is describing the simplest and easiest form of meditation practice. It requires nothing more than becoming still and relaxing the body to the point where the yogi feels that it has dissolved into or become one with infinity. Doing only that, the yogi can attain a deep state of meditation.

Following that, he makes the startling claim that this meditation can produce immunity from the pairs of opposites, such as hot and cold, joy and sorrow. Some yogis have been known to meditate in extremes of heat and cold to try to prove this point. The practice is more likely to be successful when used to maintain equanimity in times of trouble or to get a brief respite from the cares of everyday life.
