I first became aware of Samkhya philosophy early in my study of yoga, having come across the term while reading the Bhagavad Gita. Since then, I've studied it in a fair amount of depth, which has greatly aided my progress in the practice of yoga. In recent years, the text that I've relied on the most has gone out of print, that is, The Samkhya Philosophy by Nandalal Sinha. This has created a need for materials that can continue to transmit the philosophy. Toward that end, I've decided to make available free on the internet a version of a text called the Kapila Sutram, or Tattva Samasa (Compilation of Principles). 

The Tattva Samasa is a short text, only twenty-two sutras, and is said to have been used as an introductory text. It is the oldest of the Samkhya texts, and may be the work of Kapila himself, who by all accounts was the first to organize Samkhya philosophy in a systematic way. A translation of the text will be presented along with explanations based on the commentary of Narendra. This is not intended to be a verbatim copy of Narendra's work, but an adaptation with updated language and all of the salient points included. 

Plans for the production of this material have not yet been finalized, as other material is already in progress. Please check back for updates.
