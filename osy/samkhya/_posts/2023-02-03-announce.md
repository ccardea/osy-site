I first became aware of Samkhya philosophy early in my study of yoga, having come across the term while reading the Bhagavad Gita. Since then, I've studied it in a fair amount of depth, which has greatly aided my understanding and progress in the practice of yoga. In recent years, the text that I've relied on the most has gone out of print, that is, The Samkhya Philosophy by Nandalal Sinha, originally published in 1915. This has created a need for materials that can continue to transmit the philosophy. Towards that end, Old School Yoga will be publishing an introduction to Samkhya philosophy as a free resource here on this website.

The focus of Old School Yoga is primarily on the practice of yoga. With that in mind, the current plan is to present those topics that are most relevant to our primary focus. Because the Samkhya philosophy is based strictly on reason, the Samkhyas engaged in sometimes elaborate reasoning processes to provide a basis for their conclusions. With a few exceptions, most will omitted and only the conclusions will be presented.
