I first became aware of Samkhya philosophy early in my study of yoga, having come across the term while reading the Bhagavad Gita. Since then, I've studied it in a fair amount of depth, which has greatly aided my understanding and progress in the practice of yoga. In recent years, the text that I've relied on the most has gone out of print, that is, The Samkhya Philosophy by Nandalal Sinha, originally published in 1915. This has created a need for materials that can continue to transmit the philosophy. Toward that end, Old School Yoga will be publishing a short introduction to the philosophy here on the website. 

The primary focus of Old School Yoga is on the understanding and practice of Yoga. With that in mind, the topics to be covered will be those that are most relevant to that purpose.
