One may rightly ask, why should we study this ancient material? What value does it have for our society that is so much more technologically advanced? Samkhya was the dominant world view of its time and many Hindu texts, especially the Yoga Sutras, were written from its point of view. If we attempt to read the Yoga Sutras, for example, from our own frame of reference, we will not be able to understand it. We must first understand the author's frame of reference before we can make sense of his work.

Samkhya philsophy was the closest thing the ancient world had to science. While not up to modern standards, it demonstrates remarkable intelligence in many ways. And while the Samkhya tattvas may not be scientifically proved in the modern sense, they are nevertheless useful for the purposes of yogic introspection, and they seem to work.
