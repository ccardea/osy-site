title: Jnana + Yoga = Yoga Sutras

#### Yoga Sikha Upanishad 1.2
>Some people say that the only way out is Jnana (knowledge). To attain occult powers, that alone will not suffice. How can Jnana without Yoga lead to salvation? It is also true that Yoga alone without Jnana will not lead to salvation. So the one who aims at salvation, should learn Jnana and Yoga together. 

The Yoga Sutras represents the combination of Jnana and Yoga. Large portions of the text are concerned with acquiring and perfecting knowledge, and not only ordinary knowledge but also knowledge that leads to higher consciousness. Old School Yoga regards the Jnana portions as generally not well understood in traditional translations. Correct understanding can be obtained only by careful analysis of the text. This material is better suited to those who already have a basic understanding of yoga, and will be presented separately. 

The Yoga Sutras is well known for its enumeration of 8 limbs or members of Yoga. Patanjali's 8 Limbs are a good place to begin the study of Yoga philosophy. This material will be made available here as a free resource for beginning students. Before beginning the study of the eight limbs, it will be helpful to understand exactly what is yoga, according to Patanjali.
