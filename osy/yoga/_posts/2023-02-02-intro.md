>Some people say that the only way out is Jnana (knowledge). To attain occult powers, that alone will not suffice. How can Jnana without Yoga lead to salvation? It is also true that Yoga alone without Jnana will not lead to salvation. So the one who aims at salvation, should learn Jnana and Yoga together. *Yoga Sikha Upanishad 1.2*

I am one who aims at salvation, not because I'm a saint, but because my sins are great.

I believe that the Yoga Sutras represents the combination of two different traditions, Samkhya-Yoga and Yoga-Vedanta. The Samkhya-Yoga is Jnana and Yoga-Vedanta is the more religious Yoga. This can be shown in the text fairly easily. The Yoga Sutras is well known for its enumeration of 8 Limbs. This is a large part of the Yoga-Vedanta, and is well understood. The Samkhya-Yoga, on the other hand, is not as well understood. The reason for that is, the Vedanta has been dominant in India since the time of Shankara, around the 8th century, C.E.. Consequently, Samkhya has been somewhat overlooked, and perhaps even discouraged. 

The 8 Limbs are a good place to begin the study and practice of Yoga philosophy, and will be presented here as a free resource for beginning students. At some point in the not-too-distant future, the Samkhya-Yoga portion of the Yoga Sutras will be made available separately. This will be a valuable addition to the understanding of yoga, and may, in fact, represent the re-discovery of knowledge that had been lost for quite some time. In order to impress upon readers that this knowledge has value, and in order to protect copyrights, this material cannot be made freely available on the internet. An announcement will be made when the material becomes available. 

Production of the Asta-anga material will begin in the near future and will be published incrementally as it becomes available. Please check back soon.
