title: The Philosophy of Yoga

Yoga is one of the six *darsanas*, or schools of Hindu philosophy. The authoritative text of Yoga philosophy is The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, which was written probably 2,000 years ago or more. It was at one time almost forgotten but is now known throughout the world as the primary source that forms the foundation for the practice of yoga. It is different from other texts such as the Hatha Yoga Pradipika and the Upanishads in that it is considered a work of philosophy while they are not. It is also different from modern yoga practices that are concerned primarily with health and fitness derived from physical practices. The primary focus of the Yoga Sutras is on the systematic practice of meditation leading to self-realization. It demonstrates a very high level of intelligence and organization, but can be a bit overwhelming for a beginning student.

For that reason, Old School Yoga has chosen to make available as a free resource for beginners, an excerpt from the Yoga Sutras that is known as the Eight Limbs. This material is well-suited for beginners and is presented in a way that is understandable for a person of average intelligence. Before beginning the Eight Limbs, it will be helpful to understand exactly what is yoga, according to Patanjali.
