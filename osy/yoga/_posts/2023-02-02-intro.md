title: Jnana + Yoga = Yoga Sutras

#### Yoga Sikha Upanishad 1.2
>Some people say that the only way out is Jnana (knowledge). To attain occult powers, that alone will not suffice. How can Jnana without Yoga lead to salvation? It is also true that Yoga alone without Jnana will not lead to salvation. So the one who aims at salvation, should learn Jnana and Yoga together. 

I believe that the Yoga Sutras represents the combination of two different traditions, Samkhya-Yoga and Yoga-Vedanta. The Samkhya-Yoga is Jnana and Yoga-Vedanta is called simply, Yoga, in the passage quoted above. It is possible to differentiate one from the other by identifying where it comes from and what explains it. Some passages of text are explained almost entirely by Samkhya philosophy, and others have been adapted from the Upanishads.

The Yoga Sutras is well known for its enumeration of 8 Limbs. This is known to have been adapted from several different versions found in the Upanishads, and Patanjali's version has become the standard. The 8 Limbs are a good place to begin the study of Yoga philosophy, and will be published here as a free resource for beginning students. Production will begin in the near future and will be published incrementally as it becomes available. At some point in the not-too-distant future, the Samkhya-Yoga portion of the Yoga Sutras will be made available separately.
