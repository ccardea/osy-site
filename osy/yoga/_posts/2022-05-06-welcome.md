Yoga is the restraint of the functions of consciousness. These are some of the best known words in the culture of yoga, taken from Yoga Sutras 1.2. But they raise more questions that they answer. What are the functions of consciousness? What is meant by restraint? After all, some people interpret that as cessation or stopping. Why should we restrain or stop the functions of consciousness? All those questions get answered in the Sutras. For now, let's just say it's about slowing down the whirl of consciousness which is usually caught up in our daily activities, so that we begin to recognize the true nature of our being.

What? How does this have anything to do with the ladies at the yoga studio? For some people, the whole practice of yoga consists of the asanas they do at the studio, or along with a You Tube video or an app. That's fine, but they're missing out on much that yoga has to offer. The Yoga Sutras goes deep into topics like human experience and psychology and how we can transform our selves, but fundamentally, yoga is a *practice* that requires individual effort. The asanas are really a means to an end, but only one of the means. So, one of the first things we should become aware of are the other means. These are known as the Eight Limbs or Asta Anga Yoga.
