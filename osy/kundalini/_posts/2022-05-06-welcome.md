title: The Vedanta School of Kundalini
---

Kundalini is a long-standing esoteric yoga practice. Few people understand it correctly and there has been a lot of misinformation, fear, and skepticism around it. There are three main sources of information about Kundalini:

1. The much maligned Yogi Bajan is currently best known,
1. The rather obscure tantric texts,
1. The Yoga Kundalini Upanishad and related upanishads.

The Vedanta School of Kundalini is a term coined by Old School Yoga to describe the kundalini taught in the Upanishads, and to differentiate it from the others. The goal of this site is to present accurate information about the practice, so that those who wish to pursue this path can do so with confidence.
